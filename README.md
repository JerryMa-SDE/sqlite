[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine.

This repository is an unofficial release of [pre-packaged amalgamation source code](https://www.sqlite.org/howtocompile.html) with CMake support.
